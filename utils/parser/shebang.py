    We only support UTF-8 programs & arguments.  The OS usually doesn't have
    such restrictions, but until such a use case comes up where non-UTF-8 data
    is needed, assume it to simplify the code (strings are easier to handle).

    Args:
        data: The first line of a shebang file, for example
            "#!/usr/bin/env -uPWD python foo.py\n". The referenced command must
            be an absolute path with optionally some arguments.

    Returns:
        A Shebang with the command & arguments broken out.

    Raises:
        ValueError if the passed data is not a valid shebang line.
