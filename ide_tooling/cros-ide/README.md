# Chrome OS Development in Visual Studio Code

CrOS IDE makes Chrome OS development fast and fun by anchoring existing tools
in one place, and making them discoverable and easy to use.

It is a new project, currently in dogfood, and it was tested only for Google
internal developers. No timely support will be provided to other parties.

## Features

Initial release has been tested for `platform2` development and offers the following features:

* Autocompletion, x-ref searching, and symbol definition for C++.
* Linting (C++, Python, Shell, GN).
* Boards and packages view, Code Search integration, short links support (crbug, etc.), and so on.

See [QuickStart Guide] for setup instructions.
