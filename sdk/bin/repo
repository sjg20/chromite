You're trying to use `repo` inside the ChromiumOS SDK. That is deprecated, and
`repo` will eventually be removed from the SDK. Please consider running your
command outside the chroot. If you find bugs with `repo` outside the SDK (e.g.,
with pre-upload checks), please file a Build Infra bug (go/cros-build-bug /
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=1037860).
